        <p className="font-bold text-5xl">Humble beginnings</p>
        INISTR was founded in 2016 in Partille just outside Gothenburg by a group of friends with a shared passion for creating games. Together they realised that they enjoyed making games but didn't like being dragged down in economics and paperwork. They decided to start a company that would help other developers and creators to focus on what they do best, while keeping the business side of things to what today is known as INISTR. INISTR 
        
        <p className="font-bold text-5xl">INISTR today</p>
        Today INISTR is a global actor with offices in Sweden, Canada, India and Australia employing over 1 900 people. Our main focus is working together with game developers as we've done from the start, but in recent years we've been expanding to other forms of interactve media. Over the years we've worked together with several strong brands and publishers in the industry, many of which later have joined the INISTR family.

        <p className="font-bold text-5xl">Looking forward</p>
        We have seen the impact that INISTR has had on the industry and we are proud of what we have accomplished. We are now looking forward to the future and what it will bring. We are always looking for new opportunities and new ways to help our partners and clients to reach their goals. In the future we're hoping to reach more clients, both in established regions as well as new ones, while also expand our services to other relevant industries.
